This program uses MySQL server and PySimpleGUI to create a database management system which logs meetings among users in a database. It shows probable cases of the COVID19 and ease over management of the users and meeting data. 


To use the project, a MySQL server should be running  on localhost or you could edit host for the connection in the code. Then you enter as many users you desire.
Log a meeting between users and you're all done. To update user Info , click the update button and then change the info as per management needs.It was originally intended to be used in a small scale environment hence the lack of graphs for the data, like a society and the gaurd logs all visitors and users. If the visitor has COVID he isn't allowed to visit the user. If the user has covid he isnt allowed any visitors.
